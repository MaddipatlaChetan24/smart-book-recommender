## Installation & Setup

### Method 1: Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/Book-Recommender-System.git
cd Book-Recommender-System
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application**
```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Method 2: Docker Setup

**Using Docker Hub:**
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 adilshamim/book-recommender
```

The recommender system analyzes patterns in book metadata and user ratings using two complementary machine learning approaches:

### Recommendation Algorithms

1. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Recommends books based on similarity between users
   - Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction
   - Applies cosine similarity to find related books
   - Best for discovering new books similar to user preferences

The system uses pre-trained ML models for fast inference without requiring real-time retraining

The system leverages comprehensive book datasets containing:
- **Book Metadata**: Titles, authors, publishers, publication years
- **User Interactions**: Ratings and reviews data
- **Content Features**: Categories, genres, and textual descriptions
- **Popularity Metrics**: Books sorted by user engagement and ratings

All data is pre-processed and vectorized using TF-IDF to enable efficient similarity computations.
- [ ] **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combine collaborative + content-based filtering
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Persistent user profiles and history
- [ ] **Advanced NLP**: Sentiment analysis on book reviews
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] **API Integration**: Connect with Goodreads/OpenLibrary APIs
